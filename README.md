#### 3. Installing MongoDB
Install and run MongoDB by following the instructions on this [site](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/). Then, install MongoDB compass GUI from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) to interact with the data outside of the command line.

#### 4. Start Compass
Start Compass by using this URL to connect the database to our web application: `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

If you get a MongoDB error that looks like this: `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017`. Run `brew services restart mongodb-community` in the command line in the project's directory.

#### 5. Run the App Locally
Use the `nodemon` or `node index` commands to launch the application. If Nodemon causes an error, run `npm install -g nodemon` and try the `nodemon` command again.

#### 6. Create an account, log in and enjoy Hue
