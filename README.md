# Hue
This is our group project for SHU Assignment one. We have created a web application that allows users to create an account and sign-in. The purpose behind this product is to let people create palettes based off of a specific colour they had in mind and this can help them with identifying which colours they want to wear together or how they would like to paint their house.
