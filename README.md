### Hue ###
This is our group project for SHU Assignment one. We have created a web application that allows users to create an account and sign-in. The purpose behind this product is to let people create palettes based off of a specific colour they had in mind and this can help them with identifying which colours they want to wear together or how they would like to paint their house.

### Installation ###
1. To be able to use Hue please copy the repository to your local machine using your chosen IDE.
2. Open a terminal and use the command "_npm install_" to make sure each package is successfully install and up to date.

3. Install Mongo DB compass GUI from (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
4. Start Compass and use this URL to connect the database to our webpage mongodb://localhost:27017
5. Use "_nodemon_" or "_node index_" to launch the website.

Should you get a MongoDB error that looks like this 'ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017', run "brew services restart mongodb-community" in a terminal in the repos directory and this shoudld fix any errors.
